# OLED Desktop
A True Black [Rainmeter Skin](https://www.rainmeter.net/) designed for OLED Screens.

> ⚠️ **This skin is a work in progress and is basically in alpha.**

## Features
- True black background overlay
- Hides top of the taskbar when it is hidden
- Hides desktop widgets and mouse cursor on inactivity
- Weather data is retrieved independently from weather widget

## Description
This skin is designed for OLED screens. It aims to prevent burn-in and conserve energy by keeping your desktop as black as possible at any given moment. On inactivity, widgets and mouse cursor are hidden. Widgets only appear at given moments. The clock, for instance, will appear every 5th minute right before the minute value changes and disappears shortly after.

This skin is also just a fun experiment for me to play around with, so expect some weird stuff 😉

## Current limitations
- Weather data is not retrieved automatically
- Hiding of widgets and cursor is still a bit buggy
- README.md that is severely lacking 😋
- Mouse cursor while hovering over the desktop is my own default mouse cursor (and probably not yours)
- Probably more...
