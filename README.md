# OLED Desktop
A True Black [Rainmeter Skin](https://www.rainmeter.net/) designed for OLED Screens.

> ⚠️ **This skin is a work in progress and is basically in alpha.**

## Features
- True black background overlay
- Hides top of the taskbar when it is hidden
- Hides desktop widgets and mouse cursor on inactivity
- Weather data is retrieved independently from weather widget

## Current limitations
- Weather data is not retrieved automatically
- Hiding of widgets and cursor is still a bit buggy
- README.md that is severely lacking 😋
- Probably more...
